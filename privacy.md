Bike Tag collects location data and photos as part of game play. We *only* use
this information in pursuit of game play, and never share this information with
a third party. For more details on what we collect read below.

Location is monitored while the app is open to determine which spots are most
relevant to you (so we don't show you a spot in Hawaii while you're biking
around Botswana). Furthermore, we use your phone's GPS coordinates to validate
that you *have* indeed found an existing Bike Tag.

As part of gameplay, you upload photos from your camera. These photos become
publicly accessible. I hope that's not a surprise as the point of Bike Tag is
to share spots. Do *NOT* take a picture of something in Bike Tag unless you
want it made publicly accessible. If you've taken a really good photo, we might
use it to promote Bike Tag, e.g. on this website or in the app store.
